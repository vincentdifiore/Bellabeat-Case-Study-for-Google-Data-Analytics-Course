Business Goal: 
- Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.
- Apply insights from analysis to one Bellabeat product, mock present to stakeholders (Owners, Exec Team, Marketing Analytics Team)
- Overall: Help guide marketing strategy for Bellabeat with high level recommendations.

Prepare
- Will be using public data to explore smart device users' daily habits. 

  FitBit Fitness Tracker Data
- Pubicly stored through Mobius. Two months worth of data for 30 users in long format.
- Bias not noted. Although there may be bias in that a person owning a FitBit may be more healthy as is, this will pertain to Bellabeat's audience anyways. 
- Credibility can be verified as FitBit is a known company, and Morbius is trusted by Google. 
- ROCCC: Relevant, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited? 
  - Not current, but passes all other tests. 
- No licensing, privacy, security, or accesdibility measures needed as data is provided publicly. 
- Data's integrity can be trusted through program. Anonymized personal info, at least 30 participants in sample size
- Data limitation issues: Time type in all csvs, Large data (1.1 million observations in some files). 

- Data Sources used: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CCO: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius)

Action items in this phase: 
  - Download CSVs, Rename files in desktop. 
    - Attempted to run python to auto download folder w CSVs, technical issues. 
    - Instead one by one. But first, need to fix data types in R or google sheets. 
    - Ended up using desktop R screipt from Chatgpt that worked like a charm to transform data types in my desktop folder. Much faster than google sheets single column fix at a time. 
  - Organize, sort, filter data.
    - Compare Calories, Intensities, and Steps as they have both Long and Wide versions (consistency check)
  - Determine credibility of data, nuances, possible gaps in knowledge. 


Process
- Transforming done to data: Renaming, changing data types, saving new files from R to bring into SQL with correct time type, standardizing names, joining both data sets into one 2 month set. 
- Store data in BigQuery
  - Couldn't mass important using python3, so adding one by one to bigquery. (Using Narrow (long) when given choice between wide and narrow). 
- March 26th, 2025: I have decided to clean, organize, filter, and transform all my data in R instead, as it is proving to process the larg amounts of data easier. 
  While looking at the data, I have checked for nulls and NAs (skimr, janitor, here, dplyr, tidyverse all very helpful)
  I have been able to filter and graph my data to check for outliers and trends. 
  Upon cleaning some of the datasets (Monthly Activity tables for either month), I have foud that there is significantly more data in tbe second month than the first. 
  Using the first month's data may skew results. I believe I may only focus on second month. 
- I believe next steps will be deciding which datsets to narrow in on, do final transformations, make some action plans for analysis, and make graphs in R and tableau. 
- I can start to cut out datasets, don't think I'll be needing all of it. And if I do, I can always come back.
