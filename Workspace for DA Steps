Business Goal: 
- Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.
- Apply insights from analysis to one Bellabeat product, mock present to stakeholders (Owners, Exec Team, Marketing Analytics Team)
- Overall: Help guide marketing strategy for Bellabeat with high level recommendations.

Prepare
- Will be using public data to explore smart device users' daily habits. 

  FitBit Fitness Tracker Data
- Pubicly stored through Mobius. Two months worth of data for 30 users in long format.
- Bias not noted. Although there may be bias in that a person owning a FitBit may be more healthy as is, this will pertain to Bellabeat's audience anyways. 
- Credibility can be verified as FitBit is a known company, and Morbius is trusted by Google. 
- ROCCC: Relevant, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited? 
  - The most relevant data tables for my purposes consist of the dailyActivity, hourlyIntensity, hourlyCalories, and hourlySteps tables 
    -  Other tables, such as minute and second tables, contain the same information, just on a smaller scale. The marketing team most likely 
    does not care about trends on the minute or second level, as it is difficult to relate these to specific types of audiences.
  - This data is original, from fitbit to Mobius.
  - The data is comprehensive in that there are at least 30 participants in our data, giving us a large enough sample size to find statistically significant evidence. 
    It is also comprehensive in that there are little to no NULL values to be found. 
    However, there are some data sets, such as the "weightloginfo" sets, that don't contain enough dates or Ids to be useful.
  - Not current, from 2016.
  - Cited.
- No licensing, privacy, security, or accesdibility measures needed as data is provided publicly. 
- Data's integrity can be trusted through program. Anonymized personal info, at least 30 participants in sample size
- Data limitation issues: Time type in all csvs, Large data (1.1 million observations in some files). 

- Data Sources used: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CCO: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius)

Action items in this phase: 
  - Download CSVs, Rename files in desktop. 
    - Attempted to run python to auto download folder w CSVs, technical issues. 
    - Instead one by one. But first, need to fix data types in R or google sheets. 
    - Ended up using desktop R script from Chatgpt that worked like a charm to transform data types in my desktop folder. Much faster than google sheets single column fix at a time. 
  - Organize, sort, filter data.
    - Compare Calories, Intensities, and Steps as they have both Long and Wide versions (consistency check)
  - Determine credibility of data, nuances, possible gaps in knowledge. 


Process
- Transforming data: Renaming, changing data types, saving new files from R to bring into SQL with correct time type, standardizing names, joining both data sets into one 2 month set. 
- Store data in BigQuery
  - Couldn't mass important using python3, so adding one by one to bigquery. (Using Narrow (long) when given choice between wide and narrow). 
- March 26th, 2025: I have decided to clean, organize, filter, and transform all my data in R instead, as it is proving to process the large amounts of data easier. 
  While looking at the data, I have checked for nulls and NAs (skimr, janitor, here, dplyr, tidyverse all very helpful)
  I have been able to filter and graph my data to check for outliers and trends. 
  Upon cleaning some of the datasets (Monthly Activity tables for either month), I have found that there is significantly more data in tbe second month than the first. 
  Using the first month's data may skew results. I believe I may only focus on second month.
    - **After further inspection, graphing by date will be less useful, so data being skewed between months doesn't matter. 
      - Will be analyzing, steps, calories, intensity, distances, etc that rely less on time. 
- I believe next steps will be deciding which datsets to narrow in on, do final transformations, make some action plans for analysis, and make graphs in R and tableau. 
- I can start to cut out datasets, don't think I'll be needing all of it. And if I do, I can always come back. 

Analysis
- I have started my analysis with visualizations in R with ggplot. So far, I have
  - Month 1 and 2 total steps on a timeline
  - Avg calories burned by hour of day, Avg intensity by hour of the day, Calories burned for total daily distance, calories burned for total daily steps, calories burned by hour of the day
- Insights so far:
  - There is not a strong correlation (only moderately positive at .59) between Total Daily Distance and Calories burned. This means that people are burning calories at a stronger rate when 
    moving less distance. WHen looking at Average Intensity and Calories burned

To do for analysis: 
  - calories burned/total steps/intensity by day of week
  - Did highly active users burn more calories/sleep better?
  - Do more steps lead to better sleep quality?
  - Do more steps = less stress? Need more data, this could be marketable. 
  - Position spring as a fitness companion if more active users drink more water.
    - Memebership: Personalized coaching can help with consistency
  - These datasets work well in clusters. Can separate users into most active/most calories burned --> do they also get better sleep? 
  - Less of a timeline dataset, more of a correlation dataset. 

Tableau:
- When uploading to tableau, date time didn't upload correctly for midnight (00:00:00 shows up as NULL for all dates containing)
- To finish Saturday last 30 min 3/29, I am going to get the sorted and filtered versions pre date tansformaiton, save them, excport them, and upload to tableau to see if they now show all dates. 


- Could create a relationship table
